Django datebook is.. a datebook !

This aims to manage user datebooks by months. A datebook contain day entries where you can add details, start and stop working hours, vacation, etc..

This does not aims to reproduce some advanced apps like Google calendar or alike, datebook is simple and will have a particular workflow for our needs (at `Emencia <http://emencia.com>`_).

Actually this is only a prototype, more details to come..

TODO
====

* Better index to browse users datebooks;
* Forms to add new datebooks and to manage their day entries;
* User permission, restriction access, etc..;
* i18n and FR translations;
